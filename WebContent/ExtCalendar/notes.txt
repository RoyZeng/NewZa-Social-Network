INSTALL:
For sample files to work fine  adjust the EXTJS files and CSS files locations

NOTES:
1.- For debugging check the files on Source folder
the order would be: 

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="calendar.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="locale/e2cs_en.js"> //choose your lang file on locale folder </script>  
<script type="text/javascript" src="calendar.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="monthview.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="weekview.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="dayview.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="task.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="scheduler.js"></script>

2.- dbcal.php and dbcal_xml.php file contains php sample code to work for e2cs_test.sql table sample just install the .sql file on a clean database or 
testing database and adjust the code to access you database file 

3.- On AIR, ASP or Coldfusion adapt your code to return a valid JSON response acording to the sample and the 
database wich you're gonna use

4.- For use with jquery or prototype please check EXTJS documentation on EXTJS ADAPTERS 
for use with jquery or prototype on the forums

5.- For Adobe Air development please check all the Xtemplate objects in the source and 
adjust them to the initial loading of AIR because this will not work  
(check EXT samples about template objects)
